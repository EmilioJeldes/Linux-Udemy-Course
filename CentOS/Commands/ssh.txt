# Create ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

* passphrase = password to encode it
* stored in ~/.shh
* id_rsa (private key)
* id_rsa.pub (public key)

# FIX
"""
sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation
Permission denied (publickey).
"""

1. Start ssh-agent
eval `ssh-agent`

2. add ssh public key (add passphrase)
ssh-add

3. List new ssh added
ssh-add -l
